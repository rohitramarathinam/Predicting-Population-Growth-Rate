# Predicting Population Growth Rate Trends from Human Geography Factors

The main goal of the project was to predict population growth rate from geographical factors that it has historically been correlated with.

## Description

There were several other goals as well, including:
* Develop an understanding of how machine learning can be used in the scope of geography
* How different machine learning models operate and what do they optimize
* The impact and importance of each selected geographical factor (features) on population growth rate (target)
* How tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning models boosts performance and predictions

In order to find the best models for predicting population growth rate, 9 models were implemented using scikit-learn, a Python library tailormade for machine learning. The following models were used and compared:
* Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* XGBoost


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This project uses sklearn and numpy so as long as you have these dependencies you should be able to run the programs!
* To run XGBoost, you may need to install it onto your device first

### Installing

* Download the zip file and extract it
* Voila

### Executing program

* To see the code, open the "code" folder through your IDE
* All the models are located in "code" and can be run from there
* Simply open the file you wish to run and click the run button on your IDE
* Some models produce several images so it's necessary to close out of the first image you see in order to see the next

* To see the final report, presentation video, and presentation slide deck, please check out the "doc" folder
* To see results and other images generated from the programs without running them, check out the "img" folder

## Help

There is another README file included in "code" to help you understand how to run each model.
